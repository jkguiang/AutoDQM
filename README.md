# AutoDQM
AutoDQM parses DQM histograms and identifies outliers by various statistical tests for further analysis by the user. Its output can be easily parsed by eye on an AutoPlotter-based html page which is automatically generated when you submit a query from the AutoDQM GUI.

## Using AutoDQM Offline

Ensure you have grid certificates under `/etc/grid-security`. Set up a voms proxy with `voms-proxy-init`.

2. Call `python ./run-offline.py [sample] [data-run] [ref-run]`

Afterwards, output files are available under `./offline` (by default).
